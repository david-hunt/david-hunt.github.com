            <p>Helping clients deliver their business objectives through design.</p>
            <p>From tackling challenges, improving user experiences and building brands, to making transformational leaps in companies’ business models, my collaborative and interdisciplinary approach can be applied in many situations.</p>

            <p>Right now, I'm disrupting the financial industry as part of the Service and Interaction Design team at Barclays by working on challenging and progressive projects that provide new value to customers and push the bank into new ground.</p>

            <p>Prior to working at Barclays, I worked in advertising at Mother London - another industry that is equally ready for disruption. As part of Mother's creative team, I provided direction, crafted assets for production and presented work to clients.</p>

            <p>The projects that I find most compelling are those that are driven by insight and connect existing products to create new value for the customers and businesses. Take a look through the various different projects I’ve worked on over the last few years.</p>
